## Abstract

Xiao Ming and Xiao Gang are two sophomore students at Joint Institute. Just after their first year, they found out that they can't afford one more year's tuition fee. But just as they were about to give up and drop out, there is a mysterious person showed up and offered a weird opportunity to earn their tuition.

Who is that mysterious? And what is he trying to do? More to find out by yourself...

## About Honor Code

If there is the same project in the future in VG101, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository doesn't take any commission for others' faults.

According to the SJTU student handbook (2019 version),

> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from others is considered plagiarism.
