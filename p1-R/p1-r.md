### 			Hand-drawing Mahjongs - art-work

### 	3. Handcards

### 	4. i) We did not use the hand-drawing cards.

### 	  iii) Some features like double stacks of cards.

### 	5. There are some features we want to implement, but due to the time issue, we didn't complete those features such as special winning condition, special winning's effects.

## Ex 2. 

### 	1. a) Monjong game is all about choice, you need to make a choice about which cards you don't want and which cards you want to catch at every moments.

### 	    b) Quickly evaluate how each card contributes to the final form of winning base on your current handcards.

### 	    c) More coplacted. At milestone 2, we haven't complete the judgement of win, so the choices and calculations are simply like where will the ball go.

### 	2. a) I think in Monjong game, every choice in terms of catching/discarding card will bring a variety of possibilities, so I think our game perform well in terms of depths.

### 	    b) Choosing which card to discard when you catch a new card.

### 		c) Calculating the possible winning cards form based on your current handcards.

### 	3. Short iteration cycles with simple but specific scene you can pass only if you lean this specific control skill.

### 	4. a) They import a brand new idea of changing the rules of the basic mechanics.

### 	    b) Let the choices of the game become "infinite-like many" to the players.

### 	    c) He developed a lot of different object which can combhine with the sentences, which seems like give you more freedom, but actually it adds lots more complexities so it actually becomes more constraints.

### 	    d) Whenever the designer want to introduce a new mechanics to the players, he will design a simple totural-like level, which you can only pass it through using that new mechanics.

### 	5. a) Harder, as mentioned in the video.

### 	    b) I think it depends. But since Bejeweled already has a very good and considerable difficulty, I think simply implement this idea is not very good.

### 	6. a) You can let 5 out of total 6 cities been destoried at first, and just pretect the left one; or you can also try hard to protect all cities at once, but that will be much harder than the previous choice.

### 	    b) The limited source, little time to react, and the game over scene "The End".

## Ex 3.

### 	1. a) Yes.

### 	    b) /

### 	2. a) Smooth, and challenging in terms of catching Mahjong and dice in the same time.

### 	    b) No, not at all. Our game is more like an competing game, so any pause will cause your competitor's game freeze in the same time.

### 	    c) We did not offer a pause, but if we do, we definitely can let the game pause in the middle, but as I have mentioned, it will break another player's playing experience.

### 	    d) I think just go through the instruction booklet is enough, since for each player, there are only 4 keys available, two are for controling the paddle, two are for selecting handcards.

### 	3. a) Almost everything expect the special winning condition, but in Mohjong, those special winning condition are just some of the regulated winning condition with a specific form, so if you get a special winning condition, you can also win, but there is no special congratulation effect.

###     	b) Yes, exactly.

### 	4. a) Our narrative part of this game is more like a background story, and it will come to an end when one wins the match, then the story will give these two players different ending.

### 	    b) In fact, I think not very good. Since there is no breautiful picture and effect for our story-telling parts, and you can even just start the game without knowing the bakcground story, so in all, I think our narrative presentation is not very good.

### 	5. a) Yes, since there are several skills you can effect another player, and also just catching the dice, cards and made a certain combaination of your handcards is quite challenging.

### 	    b) No, I think the over all experience is great. If you know the Mahjong rule well, you can get used to it and have a challenging, but not punishing experience bacause there is no accidentally failiure will occur when you're playing, and also there is no long iteration if you fail to collect certerin combination of cards faster than the other player, you can always simply re-match again.

### 	6. a) I think all are important for a basic Mahjong game logic... and in fact, there is some of the basic algorithm we haven't implemented due to the complexity problem. 

### 	    b) I think those special winning condition will difinitely add more fun and challenging for players who know the Mahjong game well and try to collect a difficult and rare cards combination.

### 	    c) I will first prepare all basic copyright-free materials for our art-work first, because it takes too much time when our game is almost done and want to add more fun function and ideas to it, but at that time, we all working-hard for finding those materials so loose our time.
